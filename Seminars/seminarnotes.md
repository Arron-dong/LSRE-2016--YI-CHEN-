Questions:
1 What is large scale requirements engineering?
2 What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?
3 What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are
discussing?

Searching answer of the questions:
1.1Large companies often manage thousands of requirements continuously arriving from multiple sources.These requirements are often inter-related and originate from an increasing number ofcustomers, end users, developers, subcontractors, product features, external system interfaces, and so on. This context is deﬁned as very large-scale RE (VLSRE) and challenges RE and management capabilities.

2.1The requirements selection process is a complex decision problem that introduces several challenges, for example, shifting goals, time stress, conﬂicting viewpoints on the value, anduncertain estimates to name just a few.To effectively improve RE decision making, more effortshould be dedicated towards decision-making aspect identiﬁcation 
2.2 Alen ljung andPersson listed ill-structured problems, uncertain environments, shifting goals, action andfeedback loops, time stress, high stakes, multiple-stakeholder situations, and organizational goalsand norms among the decision-making challenges
2.3 Ngo-The and Ruhe argued that requirements decisions are hard because of the incompleteness of the available information, and any notion of strict optimality is not appropriate in this context
2.4 Karlsson et al. [3] identiﬁed release planning based on uncertain estimates as one of the challenges in MDRE that is related to RE decisionmaking. 
2.5 Another challenging aspect of decision making, mentioned by Fogelstrom et al. andKarlsson et al. , is ﬁnding the right balance between selecting commercial requirements andinternal quality requirements. 
2.6 requirements prioritization was recognized as challenging because of conﬂicting priorities between stakeholders, complex dependenciesbetween requireme nts , or multi-objective decision problems . 
2.7 McAvoy and Butler discovered that the high empowerment level of a cohesive agile software development team maynegatively impact decision making.

Answer for question 1:
Large scale requirement engineering means the thousands of requirement continously arriving form multiple resources. And theses requirements are usually inter-related and originate from an increasing number of stakeholders such as customers, end users, developers , subcontractors,product features, external system interfaces,and so on.

Answer for question 2
There are many challenges for large scale requirement engineering. There are ill-structured problems, uncertain environments, shifting goals, action andfeedback loops, time stress, high stakes, multiple-stakeholder situations, and organizational goalsand norms among the decision-making challenges. Besides, requirements decisions of large scale requirement are hard because of the incompleteness of the available information. What's more, release planning based on uncertain estimates as one of the challenges in MDRE. Addtional,  it is difficult in ﬁnding the right balance between selecting commercial requirements andinternal quality requirements. And requirements prioritization is another challenges because of conﬂicting priorities between stakeholders, complex dependenciesbetween requireme nts , or multi-objective decision problems. Last but not least, high empowerment level of a cohesive agile software development team may negatively impact decision making.

Answer for question3:
There are many techniques for reuqirement Prioritization. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP),  Cumulative Voting, the 100-Dollar Test, Numerical Assignment (Grouping), Ranking and Top-Ten Requirements.
