Dear teacher,
I upload a .doc document which is my release planning. And there is a release planning log below.
Best regards
Yi Chen

-Running log of your experiences with the release planning exercise. – In particular, challenges (and issues) you need to learn more about, and what you are doing to find out more.

-Which articles you read (with full references)
-which tools you look at
-which methodologies you investigate. – For each challenge, inlude a brief summary of the article/tool/methodology, how it solves the challenge, and the problems you see with the solution. – For each challenge, describe, with references how you ultimately decided to address it.


Activities:
28.11.2016 - 05.12.2016(Initiation)
Start working on release planning. Read the description of release planning assignment deeply. Plan and schedule the date for each milestone. Set totally five milestones for my release planning assignment.

06.12.2016 - 13.12.2016(first milestone)
Analyze different viewpoints in the system based on the course discussion forum. Gather all 209 requirements together and classify these requirements into high-level requirements. Document these 209 requirements in the EXCEL document.

14.12.2016 - 21.12.2016(second milestone)
Search the method for requirement prioritization and release planning. Challenge: Find some of the method are really hard to implement so I read more than ten article related to requirements for requirements prioritization and building the release planning. The article reference below. Compare different techniques and methods, analyze these articles and finally choose the theme-based technique for building release planning, MoScoW method for requirements prioritization. 

22.12.2016 - 27.12.2016(third milestone)
Start write the release planning report. Prioritize the requirement based on the MoScoW method. And formulate the roadmaps for release planning. Some problems faced such as :
Problem faced: How to allocate the requirements in which specific release?
Solution: By reviewing the them-based method article [1] and MoScoW method. Then I realized that it should based on the stakeholders analysis, dependency among requirements and the importance of requirements and so on. So I made a deep analysis on these aspect to determine which requirements should be allocate in which specific release. 40% of the report finished. 

28.12.2016 - 05.01.2016(forth milestone)
Still working on the report. Make some modification in the requirements prioritization. Accomplish all requirements allocated to the release. Set date for release, analyze the resource and other aspect related to the product roadmap. Finally, finished the release planning report. 

06.01.2016 - 11.01.2016(five milestone)
Adjust the structure and format of the report. Modify spelling mistakes and read through the report. Make some final improvements.

Tools and the methodologies I looked at:
The first one is theme based product release planning. This method helps the project manager to tap hidden business opportunities by releasing highly interdependent features together. The approach favors delivering specific theme-oriented products in each release, as opposed to releasing generic products. The method allows stakeholder involvement in the early stages of release plan development, in terms of clustering features, feature prioritization, thus promoting agile methodology. And there is a tool support and detailed evaluation supports the methodology of theme based release planning.

The second one is EVOLVE. An evolutionary and iterative approach called EVOLVE given a set of requirements with their effort estimations and a their categorisation into priorities by representative stakeholders, the method uses a genetic algorithm to derive potential release plans within predefined technical constraints. The new approach has several advantages over existing methods.

The third one is MoSCOW 
MoSCoW is a fairly simple way to sort features (or requiremnt) into priority order – a way to help teams quickly understand the customer's view of what is essential for launch and what is not. Each requirement within a group shares the same priority : Must have, Should have , Could have and Won't have.

The forth is ReproTizer. This method has six steps which considered scalability problems, large disparity or disagreement between ranked weights, rank reversals, as well as unreliable results when comparing with other prioritisation methods.The advantages of this method are low time consumption and it can handle large amount of requirements. However, in my opinion,it does not consider the value of stakeholders and the dependency between the requirements.The tools link that the author provided is not accessible.
